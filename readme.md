# BasicECS
A very simple ECS system in Java.

## Usage:
* Add class BasicECS to your "main" class.
* All your systems should extend AbstractSystem, and add them to the BasicECS.
* All your entities should extend AbstractEntity, and add them to the BasicECS.
* Your components need only extend Object.
* On each iteration of your game loop, call BasicECS.process();
